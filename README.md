# Snooker_Matches
A python console application that retrieves Snooker matches that will be played on that day. I created this application so I dont have to manually check what games each day.

The database being used in this project is hosted locally on my machine and stores all of the players details. This information could have been stored in a simpler manner, however I was messing around with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio at the time so I just used that.

I personally use this application every day as I is ran on startup of my PC.
