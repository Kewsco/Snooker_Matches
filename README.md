# Snooker_Matches
A python console application that retrieves Snooker matches that will be played on that day. 

I created this console application as I was learning Python, and as a snooker fan I didn't want to be manually checking what games are on each day.

The database being used in this project is hosted locally on my machine and stores all of the players details. This information could have been stored in a simpler manner, however I was messing around with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio at the time so I just used that.

This application is run each day on my PC on Pc startup.
